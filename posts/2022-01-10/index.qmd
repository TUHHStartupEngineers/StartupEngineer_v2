In our Entrepreneurial Finance course, we had the great pleasure to welcome [Mark Miller](https://de.linkedin.com/in/markmiller7), founding partner at [Carlsquare](https://www.carlsquare.com/), one of the leading consultancies in Europe for mergers & acquisitions (M&A) of growth-oriented and innovative medium-sized companies.
Mark gave an insightful overview into the M&A market in Europe, Carlsquare’s approach to support an acquisition process, and two exciting case studies, rounded up by a teaser of what a career as an M&A consultant could look lilke.

The students very much enjoyed the talk and were engaging actively with our guest.
Thank you very much, Mark! See you next time.
