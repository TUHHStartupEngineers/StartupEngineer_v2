    "text": "In our Entrepreneurial Finance course, we had the great pleasure to welcome Mark Miller, founding partner at Carlsquare, one of the leading consultancies in Europe for mergers & acquisitions (M&A) of growth-oriented and innovative medium-sized companies. Mark gave an insightful overview into the M&A market in Europe, Carlsquare’s approach to support an acquisition process, and two exciting case studies, rounded up by a teaser of what a career as an M&A consultant could look lilke.\nThe students very much enjoyed the talk and were engaging actively with our guest. Thank you very much, Mark! See you next time."
